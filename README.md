# Music Library

A simple app to display remote data of a Music Collection. There are three tabs that sort the data either by album name, artist name, or by tracks in alphabetical order.

The app uses [Swift Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) to maintain its state and effects in a centralized place.
